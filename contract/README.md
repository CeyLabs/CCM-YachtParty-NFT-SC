# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```




### 1. Contract Deployment
- deploy the contract using ```npx thirdweb deploy``` and set the USDC & USDT address.

```
// USDC ETH SEPOLA ->	0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238
// USDC ETH SEPOLA ->	0xaA8E23Fb1079EA71e0a56F48a2aA51851D8433D0
```

### 2. Set Base URI
- Set the initial server URL as the base URI

### 3. Burn  tokenId = 3 

### 4. Activate sale
- Activate Sale status, whitelist status and whitelist as necessary
